<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I concentrate on recent advances in techniques related to simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). My researches include:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	1) fast SLAM for VR/AR on mobile devices (with external supports), e.g., ROSAC,<br />
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	2) robust SLAM in complex environments, e.g., LOOF,<br />
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	3) collaborative SLAM based on multiple sensors and multiple unmanned systems.<br />
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of me is to enable fast, robust, and accurate SLAM techniques on various hardware platforms, with the help from modern devices like GPU and ARM and state-of-the-art approaches like deep neural network.</p>
