# LOOF: LiDAR Odometry Oriented to Fusion of Point Clouds
LiDAR is widely adopted for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) because it provides high-accuracy depth measurements. However, its low vertical resolution makes it difficult to produce pleasant scene mapping results, especially when there are multiple dynamic objects in the scene. Different from existing approaches that tend to add specific components to address these issues individually, in this work, we propose to simultaneously address low vertical resolution and dynamic objects in a compact SLAM framework. In particular, we utilize standard SLAM with dynamic point detection for self-localization, short-time segmentation and association for candidate extraction, and depth interpolation with weighted fusion for reconstructing object surfaces. Related tasks such as tracking and scene flow estimation are inherent to the proposed framework. Extensive evaluations on KITTI dataset and Velodyne HDL-16E laser scanner demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
